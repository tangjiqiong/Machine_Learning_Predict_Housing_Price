# Machine_Learning_Predict_Housing_Price

This is a course-based project with the goal to choose a best method with the lowest MSE to predict the housing price. Also, it is a typycal competition on Kaggle where we could find some reference work.

Our team preprocessed the datasets including formating the datasets, dividing into training, validating, and testing datasets, standardizing and feature engineering. We compared multiple methods such as linear regression, random forest, and neural networks to implement a stack model. Finally, we researched and improved an autogun model to get the prediction which ranked 75% above baseline.
